                <h2>River Ganga is one of the most important and sacred rivers in India</h2>
                <p>
                    Water is indispensable for the basic subsistence of human
beings. It makes sense that most civilizations have emerged along
riverbanks or in river basins throughout the world. India is fortunate
to have a large number of rivers in this aspect. The holiest, revered,
and <b>significant river in North India is the Ganga</b> , the country's
national river. 44% of India's population depends on it, and it comes
from the Gangotri glacier in Uttarakhand. The riverine water
resources support the aquatic ecology and provide irrigation,
drinking water, energy, cost-effective transportation, recreation, and
religious fulfilment for a large number of stakeholders.The stories
and myths about the river and how it interacts with people and the
environment have been around for a very long time. Due to the
building of dams and barrages, the discharge of untreated municipal
and industrial waste, floral offerings, and the cremation of dead
people on its bank, Ganga is now significantly reduced in flow and
completely polluted. Both inorganic and organic toxins from
industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and religious rituals are the
main sources of pollution in the Ganga River. With varying degrees
of success, the Government of India (GOI) has tried numerous
measures to clean up the Ganga over the years, including the Ganga More than 400 million people in India and Bangladesh live
in and depend on the basin, which has a rich cultural and religious
history. It is the source of light for human civilization. People have a
great deal of faith in Ganga's abilities to heal and regenerate. It is
without a doubt the most sacred river in India, and both locals and
visitors to the country hold it in the highest regard. Due to the year-
round abundance of water, which makes up 25% of India's water
resources, Ganga has significantly contributed to the development of
Indian civilization and the economy (Paul et al., 2013). India's most
revered river, Ganga, is personified as a goddess and treated with
motherly respect. It is thought to be a soul cleanser and has been
mentioned as having therapeutic and antibacterial qualities
(Nautiyal, 2009; Rai, 2013). Today, however, habitual ingestion of
Ganga water or bathing in it run the risk of catastrophic health
consequences, including cancer.
